  This HRVA has been specially designed to give the user a comprehensive and
  useful assessment of their regions' hazards, risks, vulnerabilities, and
  capabilities. It has also been designed to incorporate the new disaster
  mitigation challenge of climate change. With a changing climate, it has become
  very important to be aware of how climate will affect disasters in your area so
  that proper adaptation strategies can be designed and adopted.
