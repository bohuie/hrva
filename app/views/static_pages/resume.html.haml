  Caution for Statistical Estimation
%p
.big
  Some questions require you to give statistical predictions. Please be aware
  that people often 
  %span.bold
    overstate 
  the odds of an event happening if they have recently experienced it and
  %span.bold
    understate 
  the odds if it has been a long time since the event occurred. Please keep
  this in mind when answering prediction questions.

  Climate Change
%p
.big
  This HRVA has been designed to incorporate climate change into its analysis.
  Climate change is forecasted to have a significant impact on weather
  throughout Canada and the world. This means it will also have an impact on
  many natural disasters. It is expected that climate change will increase the
  frequency, severity, and irregularity of natural disaster events.  This is
  important information to keep in mind as you answer the questions in this
  HRVA. The purpose of an HRVA is to estimate future risks and climate change
  is expected to increase these risks in a profound way.  For more information
  on climate change and how it will affect natural disasters, please see the
